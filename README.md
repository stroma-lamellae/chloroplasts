# chloroplasts

A [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)-like program that aims to
improve upon the existing software (perhaps address some of [these](https://github.com/genchang1234/How-to-cheat-in-computer-science-101) workarounds) and ultimately, impress Bockus.


## Project Statement

Code submissions from a class of students must be checked for academic integrity. That is, students must submit assignments and projects which are their own work and conform to the regulations of the university regarding academic integrity.
An online system of submission is needed, where a student will submit their assignment. The assignment will be added to a repository which will then undergo an analysis for similarities with other assignments; and possibly the stored repository of assignments. Thus, submissions may not only be checked against one another, but from previous offerings or defined repositories, as per the instructor’s wishes.
The program will create an analysis which returns an index of similarity with other samples. The instructor will then be presented with the ability to view the analysis and compare submissions in a user friendly environment, normally web based.
The freedom of information and the protection of personal information restricts the processing and divulging of personal information. When a student submits their work, confidentiality must be protected. Thus, this system which can be used by outside sources must be able to anonymise the submission and only return back to the client information which is compliant with these rules and regulations.
Due to intellectual property rights, the main system which performs the analysis will be housed on a brock server. The client can be the internet. At no time will client information be stored on a brock server.
The system may support multiple languages. For the minimum requirement, it must support C, C++ and Java.
