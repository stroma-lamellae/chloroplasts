        - `psql -U postgres`
        - Enter the password you set during the installation
    - Create the clientserver database: 
        - `CREATE DATABASE clientserver;`
        - (NOTE: You can change the username, database name and/or password. Just remain consistent, and modify `appsettings.json` as appropriate)
    - Create the clientserver user: 
        - `CREATE USER clientserver WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';`
    - Give privileges to the new user: 
        - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE clientserver TO clientserver;`
    - Quit psql: 
        - `\q`
- Setup the tables. In a terminal, navigate to the `ClientServer` directory (the directory that contains this README). 
    - Create the Migrations model definitions: 
        - `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
    - Create the tables in the database: 
        - `dotnet ef database update`
