# Software Requirements
- dotnet core version 2.2
- postgresql 10
    - You'll also need the npgsql driver, available through the dependency installer
- npm

# Setup
## Database
- Make note of the port you set for the database (default is 5432)
- Also make note of the password you set for the default user
- Create the database and clientserver user. Open a terminal.
    - Login to postgres using the postgres user: 
        - `psql -U postgres`
        - Enter the password you set during the installation
    - Create the clientserver database: 
        - `CREATE DATABASE clientserver;`
        - (NOTE: You can change the username, database name and/or password. Just remain consistent, and modify `appsettings.json` as appropriate)
    - Create the clientserver user: 
        - `CREATE USER clientserver WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';`
    - Give privileges to the new user: 
        - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE clientserver TO clientserver;`
    - Quit psql: 
        - `\q`
- Setup the tables. In a terminal, navigate to the `ClientServer` directory (the directory that contains this README). 
    - Create the Migrations model definitions: 
        - `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
    - Create the tables in the database: 
        - `dotnet ef database update`

## Angular App
- Navigate to the `ClientServer/ClientApp` directory in a terminal. Install the dependencies:
    - `npm install`

# Running the Client Server + Client Portal
- In the `ClientServer` directory, open a terminal to run the project.
    - `dotnet run`
    - This serves the api on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001)
    - The port for the client portal changes every time, so watch for that when the app starts
        - Look for a line that says `> ng serve "--port" "#####"`
    - If you are actively developing the api, you can use the file watcher to automatically reload the app when you save a file
        - Instead of `dotnet run` use `dotnet watch run`
        - This means your app will always be up to date with the filesystem, however the build process does take a while
